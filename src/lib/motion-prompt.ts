/**
 * Motion-prompt engine for image-to-video (i2v) generation — the quality lever of the i2v main path.
 *
 * Why this exists: the script engine already writes a per-shot `camera` movement description
 * (推拉摇移 language), but the i2v call used to send the shot's STATIC image prompt instead —
 * scene wording with zero motion language, which yields bland or unpredictable movement.
 * i2v models (Seedance 2.0 family) take composition/subject from the first frame; the text
 * prompt's job is to direct MOTION: camera path + subject micro-action + stability constraints.
 *
 * Rules encoded here (commerce-specific):
 *  - Camera: prefer the script's own `camera` field; fall back to a per-shot-type default move.
 *  - Subject micro-action per shot type: bring the frame alive WITHOUT re-imagining the scene.
 *  - Product shots get hard fidelity constraints (i2v models notoriously warp printed text/logos).
 *  - Always close with stability/artifact constraints — cheap wins against flicker & morphing.
 *  - Bilingual: follows the script language (CJK → Chinese prompt, otherwise English), because
 *    overseas projects generate English scripts and mixing languages degrades model adherence.
 *
 * Pure functions, unit-testable, no I/O.
